Solution 1

chmod -R +x /sys/devices/soc/20200000.gpio
Solution 2

Update the pi-gpio.js so that

sysFsPath = "/sys/devices/virtual/gpio";
points to the new path:

sysFsPath = "/sys/class/gpio";
Solution 3

Add line device_tree= in /boot/config.txt. That will revert the links to be in the old path. Make sure you reboot after changing the config.txt.
